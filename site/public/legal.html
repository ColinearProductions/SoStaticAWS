                        "our" or "us") collect, use, and share information in connection with your use of our websites
                        (including www.usebasin.com), services, and applications (collectively, the "Services"). This
                        Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") does not apply to information our customers may process
                        when using our Services.

                    <p>We may collect and receive information about users of our Services ("users," "you," or "your")
                        from various sources, including: (i) information you provide through your user account on the

                        practices, please contact us at matt@usebasin.com.

                    <h3 class="article-inner-heading">The Gist</h3>
                    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us, and we have a few fundamental principles we abide
                        by:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services
                            that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
                        </li>
                        <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop
                            our products, or protect our rights.
                        </li>
                        <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation
                            of one of our services.
                        </li>
                        <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public,
                            seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="article-inner-heading">Website Visitors</h3>
                    <p>Like most website operators, Basin collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                        that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Basin's purpose in
                        collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Basin's visitors
                        use its website. From time to time, Basin may release non-personally-identifying information in
                        the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                    </p>
                    <p>Basin also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                        addresses for logged in users. Basin only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses
                        under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
                        described below.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="article-inner-heading">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                    <p>Certain visitors to Basin choose to interact with Basin in ways that require Basin to gather
                        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Basin gathers
                        depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide an
                        email address. Those who engage in transactions with Basin are asked to provide additional
                        information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process
                        those transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>In each case, Basin collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to
                        fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Basin. Basin does not disclose
                        personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse
                        to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
                        engaging in certain website-related activities.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="article-inner-heading">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
                    <p>Basin may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Basin
                        may monitor the most liked and viewed entries. Basin may display this information publicly or
                        provide it to others. However, Basin does not disclose personally-identifying information other
                        than as described below.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="article-inner-heading">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                    <p>Basin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
                        those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
                        information in order to process it on Basin's behalf or to provide services available at Basin's
                        website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
                        contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
                        Basin's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Basin will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                        information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
                        described above, Basin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                        information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when
                        Basin believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
                        rights of Basin, third parties or the public at large.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are a registered user of an Basin website and have supplied your email address, Basin may
                        occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
                        keep you up to date with what's going on with Basin and our products. We primarily use our
                        various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
                        email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
                        feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond
                        to your request or to help us support other users. Basin takes all measures reasonably necessary
                        to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
                        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="article-inner-heading">Cookies</h3>
                    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
                        visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Basin uses cookies to
                        help Basin identify and track visitors, their usage of Basin website, and their website access
                        preferences. Basin visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set
                        their browsers to refuse cookies before using Basin's websites, with the drawback that certain
                        features of Basin's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="article-inner-heading">Business Transfers</h3>
                    <p>If Basin, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Basin
                        goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
                        transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and
                        that any acquirer of Basin may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this
                        policy.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="article-inner-heading">Promotional Communications</h3>
                    <p>You may opt out of receiving promotional emails or text messages from Basin by following the
                        instructions in those emails or text messages. If you opt out, we may still send you
                        non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business
                        relations.
                    </p>

                    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time,
                        and at our sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes
