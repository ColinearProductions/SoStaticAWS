                            p
                                | Like most website operators, SoStatic collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                                | that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                                | preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SoStatic's purpose in
                                | collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SoStatic's visitors
                                | use its website. From time to time, SoStatic may release non-personally-identifying information in
                                | the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                            p
                                | SoStatic also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                                | addresses for logged in users. SoStatic only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses
                                | under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
                                | described below.
                            h3.article-inner-heading Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
                            p
                                | Certain visitors to SoStatic choose to interact with SoStatic in ways that require SoStatic to gather
                                | personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SoStatic gathers
                                | depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide an
                                | email address. Those who engage in transactions with SoStatic are asked to provide additional
                                | information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process
                                | those transactions.
                            p
                                | In each case, SoStatic collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to
                                | fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with SoStatic. SoStatic does not disclose
                                | personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse
                                | to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
                                | engaging in certain website-related activities.

                                | SoStatic may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, SoStatic
                                | may monitor the most liked and viewed entries. SoStatic may display this information publicly or
                                | provide it to others. However, SoStatic does not disclose personally-identifying information other
                                | than as described below.

                                | described above, SoStatic discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                                | information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when
                                | SoStatic believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
                                | rights of SoStatic, third parties or the public at large.
                            p

                                | to your request or to help us support other users. SoStatic takes all measures reasonably necessary
                                | to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
                                | personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
