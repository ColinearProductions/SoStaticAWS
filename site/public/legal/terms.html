                        update and change the Terms of Service from time to time at our discretion without notice. Any
                        new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and
                        resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such
                        changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.</p><p>By using our Website, you confirm that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with
them.
If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our Service.
We recommend that you print a copy of these Terms for future reference.</p><div class="h3">Account Registration</div><ol><li>You must be 13 years or older to use this Service.</li><li>You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not
permitted and will be terminated.</li><li>You must provide a valid email address and any other information requested in order to

refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for

such
loss.</p><div class="h3">Cancellation and Termination</div><p>SoStatic, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse

shall
not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service constitutes the entire
agreement between you and SoStatic and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior
agreements between you and SoStatic (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the
Terms
of Service).</p><div class="h3">Questions?</div><p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">If you have any questions about these Terms of Service, please
