                            p
                                | The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new European privacy law that goes into
                                | effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR will replace the EU Data Protection Directive, also known as
                                | Directive 95/46/EC, and will apply a single data protection law throughout the EU.
                                | Data protection laws govern the way that businesses collect, use, and share personal data about
                                | individuals. Among other things, they require businesses to process an individual’s personal
                                | data fairly and lawfully, allow individuals to exercise legal rights in respect of their
                                | personal data (for example, to access, correct or delete their personal data), and ensure
                                | appropriate security protections are put in place to protect the personal data they process.

                                | The GDPR applies to all entities and individuals based in the EU and to entities and

                                | The GDPR defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable
                                | natural person. This is a broad definition and includes data that is obviously personal (such as
                                | an individual’s name or contact details) as well as data that can be used to identify an
                                | individual indirectly (such as an individual’s IP address).
